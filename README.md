## Summary
My overall goal is to keep information systems secure. I best accomplish this by:
* Helping those who create information systems create them securely, consistently, and efficiently.
* Building systems for Security Analysts to give them better, actionable information, and simple paths to remediation.
* Evangelizing secure practices throughout an organization, from Customer Service Representatives to Developers to Executives.
